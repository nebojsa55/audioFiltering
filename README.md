# audioFiltering

The script was realized on the subject [Methods of analysis of electrophysiological signals](http://automatika.etf.rs/sr/13e054mas) (13E054MAS), and for the needs of the subject [Measuring systems in computing](http://automatika.etf.rs/sr/13e053msr) (13E053MSR) at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/) under the mentorship of [prof. Dr. Nadica Miljkovic](https://github.com/NadicaSm/). 

The goal of the script is to show the basic manipulation of data in Python in an interesting way by using popular tracks.
This script allows you to load audio recordings in .wav format, display them in the time domain, then display the Fourier transform of the audio signal and filter with a Butterworth bandwidth filter. Then, the script allows you to view the Fourier transform of the filtered signal and save it to a new .wav file
